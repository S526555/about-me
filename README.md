# about
this repo is going to be used for 44386-01 AKA Web Apps this specific repo will be growing as I grow, presuming of course we learn things notable enough for this to be updated. Specifically in the Useful Tools section as well as my own introduction, as a sort of timepiece showing my progress through the commit updates.

## Recommended Tools
- [Git](https://github.com/)
Git is needed for desktop if you wish to simplify things, but you also cannot host a webpage any easier way than with GitHub Pages

- [Markdown Commands](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
A little cheat sheet/guide to Markdown commands (Markdown is the language of GitHUb Pages and is quite powerful for those like myself who aren't familiar with HTML)

- [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) A VERY useful tool for having windows run alongside Git if you choose to run it strictly from the desktop. Which may I add is a must if your role in a development team is anything but basic graphic design. Even then you may still need to commit changes from your own machine. None of which could be easier than with TortoiseGit.
