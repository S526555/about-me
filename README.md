# about
this repo is going to be used for 44386-01 AKA Web Apps this specific repo will be growing as I grow, presuming of course we learn things notable enough for this to be updated. Specifically in the Useful Tools section as well as my own introduction, as a sort of timepiece showing my progress through the commit updates.

## Recommended Tools
- [Git](https://github.com/)
Git is needed for desktop if you wish to simplify things, but you also cannot host a webpage any easier way than with GitHub Pages

- [Markdown Commands](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
A little cheat sheet/guide to Markdown commands (Markdown is the language of GitHub Pages and is quite powerful for those like myself who aren't familiar with HTML)

- [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) A VERY useful tool for having windows run alongside Git if you choose to run it strictly from the desktop. Which may I add is a must if your role in a development team is anything but basic graphic design. Even then you may still need to commit changes from your own machine. None of which could be easier than with TortoiseGit.

## Useful Tools

- [Chrome!](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-83Zt6Gr5AIV85FbCh1f9gtfEAAYASAAEgJUqvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) Yes I personally prefer and recommend chrome for all web development, testing, and presentation. It's powerful, fast, and efficient enough for the task. 

- [Node.js](Node is a Javascript extension, which runs with your code to enable you more advanced web control and hosting opportunities IF you take the time to master it. Unless you're on the NW network.... Then the Great Firewall kills your web apps on local host :(

- [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) Another framework for establishing a dynamic webpage and functions much like Node, just with claims to be better and more efficient. Personally I have no experience with Angular, and very little with Node in a functional setting. But based on what I'm reading it could be extremely promising if you found Node lacking some of your taste.
